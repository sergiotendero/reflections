How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Sometimes a typo can be added unintentionally in a file, so viewing the differences between two versions allow developers to locate the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

We can locate fastly differences between versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

For coding, I think the best is to use manual commit because automattically saved versions can meaning nothing. As a disadvantage, we can forget to save our work and lost it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is oriented to source code control, when changes often affect serveral files at a time, while Google Docs is oriented to rich text documents which changes usually are not related to other documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use to locate all changes made to files and to view differences between versions of a file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

That me more confident because I can undo and redo changes easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to create a html page

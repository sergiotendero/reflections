When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
We want it in several situations, for example: for baking up my project or for sharing my project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I might want to test or show to anybody my changes before share trough the remote repository.
